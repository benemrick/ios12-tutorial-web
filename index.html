        <h1>Multi-Modal Video Series </h1>
        <p>This iOS 12 Multi-Modal Video Tutorial will demonstrate how to perform actions in iOS 12 for
            iPhone. The documentation set will consist of a series of videos (approximately 6 videos) that
            provide on-screen workflows with audio narration describing the procedure. Each video will be
            short in duration (maximum 1 minute) and discuss a single topic. The lessons in the videos will
            document how to use features available in iOS 12, but not necessarily exclusive to iOS 12.
            Topics may include features that were introduced prior to iOS 12 and remain in the latest
            version of the software. The content of these short, individualized videos will be designed for
            easy digestion, visual appeal and thorough guidance. The videos will be hosted online through a
            media sharing and storage platform such as YouTube or Vimeo. If this is not feasible for
            submission, then the media will be hosted in a custom designed webpage. All of the elements
            of the webpage (html, css and other files) will be packaged together and represent the primary
            deliverable. Holistically, the series will help users further understand the features supported in
            iOS 12 and gain a deeper understanding of the softwareâ€™s capabilities. The documentation set
            will not cover every detail in iOS 12, but rather focus on a select subset of more nuanced and
            complex features.
